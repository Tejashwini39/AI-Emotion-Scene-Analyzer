# 🎭 AI Emotion & Scene Analyzer

## 📖 Description
The **AI Emotion & Scene Analyzer** is a computer vision project that combines 
**facial emotion recognition** with **scene/object classification** in real time.  
It uses your **webcam feed** to detect human emotions (like happy, sad, angry, surprise, neutral) 
and recognize the surrounding scene or object (like laptop, street, forest, keyboard, etc.).

This project is built using:
- **FER (Facial Emotion Recognition)** library with MTCNN for face detection
- **MobileNetV2** (a deep learning model pre-trained on ImageNet) for scene recognition
- **OpenCV** for video capture and visualization

With this analyzer, you can:
- 👀 Observe real-time facial expressions
- 🌍 Identify the environment or object in the camera frame
- 🔗 Combine both for a richer understanding of human–environment interaction
